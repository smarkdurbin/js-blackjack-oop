# js-blackjack-oop

This project contains a Blackjack class that could be used to make a JavaScript game. Unfortunately, it cannot be used for React (out of the box) because of the way that React handles state.

## Running Tests

Place this directory in the public directory of an Apache or NGINX server, and request the file test.html to run the tests. Alternatively, you could use `http-server` by browsing to the project directory in your terminal, and running the command `npx http-server`.
